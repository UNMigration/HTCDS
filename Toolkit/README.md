# Toolkit Guidance

The HTCDS toolkit is designed to accelerate the development of HTCDS-compliant case management systems by providing tools based upon common platforms that can be customised and extended by organisations as necessary. Of course, itâ€™s possible to build a new system and implement the requirement of HTCDS from the ground up using the specification. However, sometimes it is helpful to begin by using the HTCDS toolkit. HTCDS is intended to support different approaches to case management and thereby enabling companies and organisations of various sizes and operating models to utilise HTCDS.

The current version of the toolkit comprises:

1.	Microsoft Excel
2.	XLSForm and XForm survey template
3.	Salesforce Unmanaged Package

Each option is useful in different ways and is relevant to different organisations and approaches to case management.
