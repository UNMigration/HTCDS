## Trafficking Status
Trafficking status indicates whether a person related to the case has been trafficked or not. This status can be difficult to determine under certain situations. For example, if a survivor calls a helpline it might not be possible to verify details. However, it's still useful to mark a case appropriately. One status option in the field is "Possible victim of trafficking". This can be used by organizations when there are indicators of trafficking but when it hasn't been possible to formally verify. In addition to the status the organization type who is making the assertion should also be captured in the "Trafficking Status Decision Making Organization" field.

Exploitation may be considered the act of taking advantage of something or someone, in particular the act of taking unjust advantage of another for one’s own benefit/ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


## Assessment and Planning
In version 2.0 several new sections were added related to Assessment and Planning, and in particular related to risk and vulnerability. Vulnerabilities and risks vary significantly across different regions and vary by context. The previous "vulnerabilities" field has been deprecated and replaced with guidance on structuring data into three sections:

* Individual risk and vulnerability
* Household risk and vulnerability
* Community risk and vulnerability
  
The standards spreadsheet lists several example questions but doesn't specify fields at this time. It is expected that risk and vulnerability assessments would be performed several times during a case, contributing to the overal measurement of outcome for case(s).

## Labour Industry (TIER 1)
These definitions reference the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC). Ths is the international reference classification of productive activities.

| A_AgricultureForestryAndFishing                | This division includes the exploitation of vegetal and animal natural resources, comprising the activities of growing of crops, raising and breeding of animals, harvesting of timber and other plants, animals or animal products from a farm or their natural habitats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| B_MiningAndQuarrying                           | This division includes the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as solids (coal and ores), liquids (petroleum) or gases (natural gas). Extraction can be achieved by different methods such as underground or surface mining, well operation, seabed mining etc. This section also includes supplementary activities aimed at preparing the crude materials for marketing, for example, crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of natural gas and agglomeration of solid fuels. These operations are often carried out by the units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby. Mining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| C_Manufacturing                                | This division includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing. Units engaged in manufacturing are often described as plants, factories or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, units that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker’s home and those engaged in selling to the general public of products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries and custom tailors, are also included in this section. Manufacturing units may process materials or may contract with other units to process their materials for them. Both types of units are included in manufacturing. The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products. |
| D_ElectricityGasSteamAndAirConditioningSupply  | This division includes the activity of providing electric power, natural gas, steam, hot water and the like through a permanent infrastructure (network) of lines, mains and pipes. The dimension of the network is not decisive; also included are the distribution of electricity, gas, steam, hot water and the like in industrial parks or residential buildings. This section therefore includes the operation of electric and gas utilities, which generate, control and distribute electric power or gas. Also included is the provision of steam and air-conditioning supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| E_WaterSupplySewerageWasteManagement           | This section includes activities related to the management (including collection, treatment and disposal) of various forms of waste, such as solid or non-solid industrial or household waste, as well as contaminated sites. The output of the waste or sewage treatment process can either be disposed of or become an input into other production processes. Activities of water supply are also grouped in this section, since they are often carried out in connection with, or by units also engaged in, the treatment of sewage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities              | This division includes two basic activities, namely the production of crop products and production of animal products, covering also the forms of organic agriculture, the growing of genetically modified crops and the raising of genetically modified animals. This division also includes service activities incidental to agriculture, as well as hunting, trapping and related activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Forestry and logging            | This division includes the production of roundwood for the forest-based manufacturing industries as well as the extraction and gathering of wild growing non-wood forest products. Besides the production of timber, forestry activities result in products that undergo little processing, such as firewood, charcoal, wood chips and roundwood used in an unprocessed form (e.g. pit-props, pulpwood etc.). These activities can be carried out in natural or planted forests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
