Extraction can be achieved by different   methods such as underground or surface mining, well operation, seabed mining   etc. This section also includes supplementary activities aimed at preparing   the crude materials for marketing, for example, crushing, grinding, cleaning,   drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of natural gas and   agglomeration of solid fuels. These operations are often carried out by the   units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby. Mining   activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of   the principal mineral produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| C_Manufacturing                                | This division includes the physical   or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new   products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for   defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The   materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are   products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as   products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration,   renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be   manufacturing. Units engaged in manufacturing are often described as plants,   factories or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and   materials-handling equipment. However, units that transform materials or   substances into new products by hand or in the worker’s home and those   engaged in selling to the general public of products made on the same   premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries and custom tailors, are   also included in this section. Manufacturing units may process materials or   may contract with other units to process their materials for them. Both types   of units are included in manufacturing. The output of a manufacturing process   may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption,   or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for   further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the   input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the   input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the   manufacture of fabricated wire products. |
| D_ElectricityGasSteamAndAirConditioningSupply  | This division includes the activity of providing   electric power, natural gas, steam, hot water and the like through a   permanent infrastructure (network) of lines, mains and pipes. The dimension   of the network is not decisive; also included are the distribution of   electricity, gas, steam, hot water and the like in industrial parks or   residential buildings. This section therefore includes the operation of   electric and gas utilities, which generate, control and distribute electric   power or gas. Also included is the provision of steam and air-conditioning   supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| E_WaterSupplySewerageWasteManagement           | This section includes activities related to the   management (including collection, treatment and disposal) of various forms of   waste, such as solid or non-solid industrial or household waste, as well as   contaminated sites. The output of the waste or sewage treatment process can   either be disposed of or become an input into other production processes.   Activities of water supply are also grouped in this section, since they are   often carried out in connection with, or by units also engaged in, the   treatment of sewage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
