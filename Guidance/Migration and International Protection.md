## Migration and International Protection

There are many different contexts in which organizations can support victims and survivors. Sometimes it is useful to be able to classify a beneficiary according to their migration or international protection status. The following sections are intended to describe different classifications and can be used to enhanced a data management system to fully describe the status of a beneficiary.

|  Vulnerable migrant            | A migrant who, due to a mix of factors, is  vulnerable to the point where they are not able to realise their human rights, or their human rights are substantially threatened, and they are unable to remedy their situation. There is usually no one factor which which makes a migrant  vulnerable but rather vulnerability emerges due to the intersection of different factors. Such factors include but are not limited to economic insecurity, irregular status, old age, disability, and sickness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Stranded migrant | A person whose migration process has been interrupted,  who is in a precarious living and/or legal situation, and who is unable to return to their country of origin or access legal migration opportunities that would enable them to move on to another state, in order to remedy their situation. Migration processes may be interrupted through depletion/loss of initial resources or documents, by protection needs accumulated along the journey, and/or because they are caught in a crisis or become displaced. Stranded migrants are particularly vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
