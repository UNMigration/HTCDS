# We already have a digital case management system

You most likely already have a CMS which is being used to manage case data. The first step is to do a gap analysis on the fields (columns) in your system with the HTCDS fields listed as CORE. There are likely to be a number of fields which are similar or the same as the HTCDS standard. The next step is to decide whether to construct a mapping between your CMS and HTCDS or to change your system to align directly with HTCDS. In many cases, changing the system immediately to align with HTCDS might be expensive and involve data migration and additional training for users. If this is the case, then it is recommended to initially implement a field mapping solution and then incrementally adjust the existing CMS over time to align with HTCDS as other changes are implemented. This means that your system will be on a roadmap toward implementing HTCDS.
