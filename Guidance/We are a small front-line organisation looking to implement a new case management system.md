## We are a small front-line organisation looking to implement a new case management system.
	
As a small organisation, there are a growing number of lightweight technical applications on the market which may be relevant to your organisation. However, your first step is to understand any legal requirements that your organisation must adhere to - particularly with respect to managing personal sensitive data. Legal requirements vary around the world. For example, some include requirements for data localisation, which means that data must be stored in the same country. This might affect your decision on using cloud applications such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel online.
	
Next you should consider the basic functional requirements of your application. Who should and should not be able to create, edit and read case records? Do they need to be available on a mobile device? What languages does the application need to be able support? What reporting requirements do you have? What budget is available to purchase licenses?
	
Next you should evaluate tools on the market and compare them to your requirements. Use free evaluation licenses when you can. Example of the common tools on the market are:
	
* Microsoft Excel and Excel Online
* Google Sheets
* Airtable
* Google AppSheet
* Microsoft Access
* Microsoft Power Apps
	
Review the HTCDS toolkits to see if any of these are likely to help you implement HTCDS more easily.
	
Spreadsheets can be a pragmatic solution but are often limited in security and protection of data. For example, some spreadsheets allow data to be easily exported to a device which can be a security risk. Therefore, care must be taken and training should be developed to ensure authorised users follow security guidelines. One way to mitigate risk is to remove identifiable data from the tool (such as Name) and replace with a unique ID number. In this way, a separate secure copy of the mapping between ID and Name can be kept separately.
