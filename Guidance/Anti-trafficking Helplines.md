## Guidance for anti-trafficking helplines.
	
Anti-trafficking helplines come in many different sizes and configurations but most have scope of a particular country or region. It's recommended that small helplines which receive only a few calls per day consider using a similar system to small frontline organisations doing victim case management. A solution like would not need advanced helpline features such knowledge management and telephony integration which is available only with more expensive technology solutions.
	
For larger multi-person teams, it is often necessary to consider a dedicated service case management system with more advanced functionality. A number of commercial cloud-based products and services existing although currently most larger anti-trafficking helplines have used Salesforce technology. It is recommended to use HTCDS within the data model design of a helpline case management system.
	
Typical features that are used by helpline systems include:
	
* Telephony integration so that the telephone number of an incoming call can be matched to the CRM database before a helpline operator answers a call.
* Knowledge management so that helpline operators can access relevant articles and guidance relevant to a case.
* Ability to create cases automatically from web forms and mobile app channels.
* Workflow and alerting so that tasks and business processes can be automated within a helpline team.
* Dashboard and reporting capabilities to allow helpline organisations to generate operating metrics and impact reports.
* Multi-factor authentication for secure access to records.
* Ability to provide separate access control for some case records depending upon sensitivity, type or region.
* Multi-lingual capability.
	
Telephony systems are not in scope of HTCDS. However, it should be noted that a helpline would generally include a telephony service to route incoming calls to helpline advisors.
	
The HTCDS-based data model used by helplines should be similar to those used by frontline organisations to manage victim care cases. However, the nature and lifecycle of helpline cases is very different. It is important to understand these differences so that the comparison and analysis of case data is done appropriately. Firstly, calls to helplines may come from members of the public, potential victims, businesses, or public sector organisations. They may be related to a suspected case of exploitation, or they may be a call which is unrelated. Therefore, the data model of a helpline system should be extended beyond HTCDS to handle these types of calls.
	
Helpline cases related to suspected exploitation can last many months or even longer, and have many call records, emails, referrals and tasks connected to the case. Typically a helpline case will be handled by a number of helpline advisors rather than one "case owner" because it can't easily be guaranteed that the same advisor will answer the calls related to a particular case. Therefore, helpline cases must be thoroughly documented so that other helpline staff can work on the case. Often, a helpline organisation will have team members focussed on enhancing data quality in the system.
	
Often the status of a victim can't be verified. On many occasions it isn't possible to state unequivocally that someone has been trafficked or is a victim of modern slavery because the helpline doesn't have access to all evidence and the victim may be unknown to government authorities. Therefore, beneficiaries are sometimes referred to as "potential victims" within helpline terminology to indicate this uncertainty.
