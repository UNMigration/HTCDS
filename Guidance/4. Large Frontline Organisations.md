## We are a large frontline organisations looking to implement a new case management system.
	
Large organisations have additional considerations when determining how to implement a new case management system. As with any new system like this, the first step is to understand the legal requirements and constraints for managing data. This will determine what type of systems and operating procedures are required. Particular consideration should be given to local or regional personal data protection requirements.
	
Large organisations may have many programs of work and may work in more than one country. Typically there is a tension between creating a single system for operational convenience, against the range of functional requirements requiring flexibility at the program or regional level. Therefore it is essential to carefully consider which implementation model to use. In summary these are:
	
* Central system and database used by all programs and locations.
* Central system with multiple levels of customisations used by different programs and locations.
* A federated collection of smaller systems.

Central systems should be considered for large organisations operating with a centralised program structure and in one country and region. In this scenario, one system will provide the governance and control necessary to centrally manage program structures and reporting requirements and will be the least costly to manage and operate. Customisations of a single system should be kept to a minimum. In this implementation model it is recommended that HTCDS CORE is used as basis for the data model for all programs. Large organisations should consider modern cloud case management systems which offer secure access control, policy implementations, reporting and workflows.
	
A federated collection of systems is potentially useful if a large organisation delegates program management to separate regions and countries. In this implementation model it is recommended that HTCDS be used within a CMS template within a low-code lightweight solution which is then offered to regional teams to customise. This would allow flexibility for teams whilst a reusable central data model would more easily facilitate centralised reporting.
