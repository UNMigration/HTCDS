## Guidance for setting up multi-tenant services.
	
A multi-tenant case management service is a system set up by one organisation and offered to other organisations as a technology service. Each "tenant", or partner, is an organization (typically an NGO) who uses the service. Multi-tenant services are a useful way to provide access to a high-value secure system for smaller organisations who normally would not have the resources to develop and operate a system for themselves. Typically, a multi-tenant service can be developed using the HTCDS data model although additional configuration and features would need to be included to support a multi-tenant model. Some of these are:
	
* Enable access control such that each partner organisation can only have access to their own data.
* Enable referral systems so that cases can be referred or transferred to other partners in the system.
* Delegated ability for partners to report, export data and manage users.
* Centralised reporting and partner management systems for the service provider to administer the system.
* Multi-lingual capability.
* Collaboration and document management capability.
	
Multi-tenant services can be quite specialised depending upon the specific region or type of program. Typically, the service provider organization will also offer additional training and support (above and beyond traditional software services) to help organisations migrate their data and adopt the system.
