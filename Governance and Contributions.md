# Governance and Contributions

It is hoped that HTCDS will evolve to become a standard that is not only used by many organizations but also has an active community of contributors and supports. This document summarises the approach to governing the standard.

## Stakeholders

### HTCDS Sponsor and Owner
As the standards owner, IOM will guide the development of HTCDS, encourage adoption, and engage the wider community for contributions and review. As the sponsor, IOM works to ensure the sustainability of the platform, and the various tools and resources associated with the standard. This standard is managed by the [CTDC](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/) team within IOM.

### HTCDS Developers and Governance Board
Comments and contributions to HTCDS from all interested organizations are encouraged. In addition, a core group of developers and reviewers will be responsible for ongoing change reviews and releases of HTCDS. These organizations are:

- IOM (development lead)
- Phil Bennett (independent consultant)

We are actively looking to grow the community. If you or your organisation would like to contribute on an ongoing basis to the development of this standard then please email [info@ctdatacollaborative.org](mailto:info@ctdatacollaborative.org) for further information.

## Comments and Suggestions

If you don't feel able to contribute on an ongoing basis but have suggestions or would like to report a bug, then the team would welcome your ideas and thoughts! To do this you need to create a github issue. An issue is a report or suggestion. To do this, first create yourself a new free github.com private account if you don't already have one. Then, browse to https://github.com/UNMigration/HTCDS and follow the instructions here to create a new issue: https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue

## Development lifecycle

HTCDS uses two processes to maintain and update the standard. The first manages major updates which contain contributions from the HTCDS developers and governing board of contributing organizations. This process adopted is:

- Core cycle for updates every 6-12 months involving developers and review board.  **Propose → Develop → Review → Publish**
- The second process manages comments, minor updates and recommendations from the wider community. **Propose → Approve → Develop → Review → Publish**

Contributions from the wider community are strongly encouraged, and will only strengthen the standard and ensure its success. Similarly, organizations interested in being members of the development team and governing board is also strongly encouraged to contact IOM for further information.
